🕵️ Dark Web Monitoring Tool
A Python-based tool that checks if your email, phone number, or password has been compromised and leaked on the dark web. The tool compares user input against a pre-existing dataset of leaked credentials and provides immediate feedback on whether your data is at risk.

📌 Features
Leaked Credential Check: Check if your email, phone number, or password appears in dark web leaks.
Real-time Feedback: Get instant alerts if your data has been compromised or is safe.
Easy-to-Use Interface: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly, interactive experience.
Dataset Integration: Checks user input against a pre-loaded CSV dataset of leaked credentials.

🧠 Tech Stack
Python – Programming language
Streamlit – For the user interface
Pandas – To handle and process the dataset of leaked credentials
CSV – For storing and reading the dataset of leaked credentials

🚀 How It Works
Enter Information: Users input an email, phone number, or password they wish to check.
Dataset Comparison: The tool compares the input against a dataset of known leaked credentials (CSV file).
Results: Instant feedback is provided—whether the input has been found in the leaks or not.

🛠️ Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dark-web-monitoring-tool.git
cd dark-web-monitoring-tool

Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app:
streamlit run app.py
🔄 Dataset Requirements
The tool relies on a CSV file (cleaned_credentials.csv) containing leaked credentials. The file should have three columns: email, phone_number, and password. Make sure the dataset is formatted correctly and located in the same directory as the app.

🚨 Disclaimer
This tool checks user inputs against a pre-existing dataset of known dark web leaks. It does not guarantee that all leaked data is included, as new leaks are constantly occurring.

🔮 Future Enhancements
🌐 Add API integration for real-time dark web monitoring.

🔒 Encrypt and secure sensitive data during checks.

📊 Add data visualization to show leak trends and statistics.
